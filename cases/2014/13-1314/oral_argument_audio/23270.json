Then the second question is, if there's not time and then there is a judicial plan, and let's say the first cycle of elections takes place under the judicial plan."

And this Court, in the Perry case, for example, rejected the idea that it's like you got one shot at this and then you're done for the whole decennial census. Now, there's at least one State, Colorado, that's basically said that if you get into that situation, then you got to live with the judicial plan until the next census; but then the legislature still kicks in and has the primary role. Now, I'm inclined to think that what Colorado has done is inconsistent with the Elections Clause."
