Glick standard in the due process claims of pretrial detainees. In a subsequent case, if the Court wants to reconsider what the test should be even under the Eighth Amendment and apply it uniformly across pretrial detainees and convicted inmates, that may make some sense. I also think there's some very interesting questions lurking out there about what kind of objective evidence of unreasonableness is enough in an Eighth Amendment case, or if we prevail, a Fifth Amendment case, what kind of objective evidence is enough to get to the jury on the subjective intent question."

And then the rest of the factors inform that as, of course, they always would. And I think one way of thinking about the question before the Court in this case is that this Court has already borrowed the -- the Johnson v. Glick factors that were due process factors -- they've already borrowed them and used them in the Eighth Amendment context. And the question in this case is should they take that due process test and apply it in a due process case? And that doesn't sound like a difficult question, and I really don't think it is."
