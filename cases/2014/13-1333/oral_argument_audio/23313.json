The Fourth Circuit in the Henslee case specifically relied on the phrase \u0022prior occasion\u0022 and said that, \u0022The phrase prior occasion may refer to a single moment or to a continuing event to an appeal independent of the underlying action, or to the continuing claim, inclusive both of the action and of its appeal.\u0022 And that\u0027s, of course, precisely the argument we\u0027re making today. But with regard to administrability, I just want to be clear about how this works, because this is obviously a very important practical issue for district courts. Under our interpretation, all that a district court, or for that matter a court of appeals, need do is to look to see whether in a prior case there has been a determination that a prisoner has three strikes."

Under Respondent\u0027s and the Federal government\u0027s interpretations by contrast, there is no such ease of application because a court will not be able to be sure that a prisoner, in fact, has three strikes even if the prisoner has previously been barred.
