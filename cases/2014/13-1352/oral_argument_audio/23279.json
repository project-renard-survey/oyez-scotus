All of those things are ongoing crimes, but gathering statements that help both stop the harm that\u0027s occurring and are useful in the criminal justice proceeding, we think, still are testimonial when that criminal incentive and purpose is intertwined with the protective purpose. Even my adversary, I think, acknowledged that even if it were nothing other than the teacher trying to get information for protective purposes -- that is, removing LP from the custody of an abuser -- that\u0027s a civil case and civil process, which I wholeheartedly agree would still trigger the Confrontation Clause."
