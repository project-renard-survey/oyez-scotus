Koray and a provision of federal statute says that a defendant generally must be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment, for anytime he has spent in official detention before the date the sentence commences and here the respondent Koray before his sentence commenced, a federal magistrate judge had released him on bail pursuant to the bail Reform Act but ordered him confine to a community treatment center, and when his prison sentence began he asked the Bureau of Prisons to credit towards his sentence, the time he spent at the treatment center and the Bureau refused this request and so Koray suit in the District Court and lost there, and then he took his case to the Court Of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the Court Of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in his favor and because there was a split in the court we granted certiorari and in an opinion filed with the court today we reverse the Third Circuit and hold that the respondent is not entitled to a sentence credit because of the time he spend at the treatment center while released on bail."
