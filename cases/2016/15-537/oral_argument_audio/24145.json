But if there's a separate conviction in the case, maybe overlapping with the overt act, even if that conviction is set aside, the defendant could point to it and say this shows that the jury must have resolved the agreement issue in my favor on that separate verdict of acquittal.

In fact, Powell said that the most obvious explanation for that kind of inconsistency is that jurors were convinced of guilt and decided to acquit out of lenity. And it would be particularly inappropriate, I think, to accord preclusive effect to that kind of verdict based on lenity, because it would essentially magnify the effects of the jury's nullification and extend it far beyond the compromise the jury itself struck and affect other counts beyond what the jury ever intended. And so I think Powell rightly recognized that when we're in a situation where we can't know that the jury was following its instructions and applying a lot of fact in a rational manner, then the defendant's not able to carry the burden to show that the acquittal is the verdict that -- that the jury truly meant and intended to resolve the factual disputes in the case. I think that we cite a number of examples as well where it's clear that there are a number of examples where there will be ambiguity in what an acquittal resolved, even separate and apart from inconsistent verdict."

And so I think Yeager itself emphasized that although we do have these finality concerns, a verdict of acquittal is final only with those issues that it actually decided, and Yeager was able to conclude that the jury in that case, through the acquittal, did decide issues in the defendant's favor as opposed to, for example, deciding to acquit out of compassion, exercise lenity, or neglect to follow instructions through the count of acquittal.
