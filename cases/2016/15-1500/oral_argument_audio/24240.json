We certainly think you should because we think for 50 years, starting with the Davis decision in 1968, Federal courts have recognized immunity, sometimes they call it tribal immunity, sovereign immunity. Sometimes they call it official immunity, sometimes they call it sovereign immunity."

So I agree that there are going to be some of those cases, but I think the logic of all of the pre-Westfall decisions, as well as the Westfall Act, is to say, we're not getting into that about -- you know, as long as the person is a Federal employee, then they have official immunity. And here, as long as the person is a tribal employee and as long as -- is -- and because the State of Connecticut does have a remedy against any sort of concerns, so if they were concerned about your situation about fearless driving, they can do -- and negotiate in the compact, as New Mexico has done, for something else and say, look, we want this channeled into State court, we insist that you waive immunity, there are a host of remedies that are available to States in this circumstance and, indeed, Connecticut availed themselves of them in this compact. And now what these folks are asking for is to renegotiate that compact and ask for something up and beyond what the State of Connecticut has provided. If there are no further questions?"
