Because if you take a look at page 49 of Petitioner's brief, they argue that we would fall within the assignee exclusion, which refers to a -- a person who receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in default, solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another. To reach even a situation in which an entity is collecting a debt for itself, their argument as to why we would fall within that exclusion is that we would be standing in the shoes of the originator; and, therefore, when we are collecting the debt for ourselves, we are collecting the debt for another, in other words, for an entity other than the originator. And so to the extent that Congress included that exclusion, it works perfectly well under our interpretation."
