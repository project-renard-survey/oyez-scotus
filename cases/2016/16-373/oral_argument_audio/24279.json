The other side has a tendency to invoke the phrase \"statute of repose,\" which isn't really self-defining in the phrase, in no event, when there's more going on in the statute than that, so I thought I would just start with the text, and it begins, \"no action\" -- and action is going to be the important noun here. \"No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under Section 11 unless brought\" -- and that's going to be the operative thing that has to happen -- \"within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\" The three-year period will follow in the next sentence, but we can pause here for just a second because it teaches a lot. We know that American Pipe tolling applies to this sentence, and therefore, we know a few things, and it's conceded and everyone agrees. The action is brought on --"

Now, if you contrast that with the Clayton Act at issue in American Pipe, there -- we can quibble about whether the language was as emphatic, but importantly, that language itself was -- was suspended or tolled if there was a government enforcement action. And what this Court held, at least as I read American Pipe, is that we know that was a statute of limitations because it was subject to tolling in at least one circumstance. And what this Court said in the Wallberger case, of course, is, when you have a time limit that's subject to tolling, that's a hint that it's a statute of limitations because the defining feature of a statute of repose that makes it different from a statute of limitations is that it's not subject to tolling or estoppel. And since American Pipe was emphatically a rule of tolling, the Court used the word \"tolling rule,\" \"toll,\" \"tolling\" at least a dozen times in the opinion. That tolling rule simply does not apply to a statute of repose like Section 13. And I think --"

But the second thing is, with all due respect, I think that your effort to say that this is -- that American Pipe's not equitable tolling is built on a mistaken premise, because -- and it follows directly from the argument my friend on the other side made, which seems to flow from the premise that in order for it to be equitable tolling, it has to take into account all the individual circumstances of the case. And as this Court said in Waldburger, in talking about equitable tolling, two of the classic situations for equitable tolling are categorical rules: infancy and, essentially, lack of mental competence. Those are two equitable rules for when a statute of limitations are tolled, and they're equitable rules. I think the equitable rule that this Court established in American Pipe, and why it was right on two occasions to refer to it as a rule of equitable tolling is that, if you were a member of a timely commenced class action, you have an equitable basis to toll the statute of limitations. I think it's as simple as that."
