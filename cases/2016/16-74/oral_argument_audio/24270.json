So what we have now today, and I don't think this is disputed, we know -- the one thing we do know is that (C)(i) plans can be maintained wholly and completely and absolutely outside the church and can include solely, completely, and wholly outside the church all the employees of any tax-exempt, religiously affiliated employer. So it just defies both common sense and our background understanding under ERISA to require the church to establish someone else's benefit plans when we know employers are usually the ones who set the employment benefits for their own employees."

And then all of a sudden, almost immediately after the legislation is passed, the IRS is believing and stating that it's done more than you claim. Isn't that, in itself, evidence -- not the Skidmore deference -- but evidence that the agency believed that the answer was different than you're promoting right now?"
