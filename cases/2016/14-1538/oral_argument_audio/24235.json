And so my only point, Mr. Chief Justice, just so that I'm not misunderstood here, is Congress -- when Congress, rather than what it started to do, which was to count down -- enact something that counted down from all the components, it instead scrapped it at the United States' suggestion and started from the ground up from contributory infringement, which is just one component specially designed, and active inducement, which doesn't require the supply of any components. Now, in this instance, and this goes, I think, to Justice Breyer's question about extraterritoriality, Congress was very careful -- of course, as this Court recognized in Microsoft, there are extraterritorial implications because it concerns exporting things for something to be done in commerce overseas."

Send them notice that what you're sending is a staple article that's a major component of a piece that's in the patent, and that if you send -- keep sending that, you're going to violate that patent and we're going to come after you. And what's that going to do? That's going to disrupt the supply chain in the United States, and the ultimate effect is going to be twofold: Either purchasers outside the U.S. will stop purchasing from inside the U.S., or U.S. manufacturers will go offshore. And the one thing we know that 271(f) was never intended to do was to accomplish that kind of an -- that kind of an impact -- negative impact on the U.S. economy. I urge the Court to reinstate the -- the judgment as a matter of law that the District Court entered. Thank you, Your Honors."
