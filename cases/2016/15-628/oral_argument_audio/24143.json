The tippee who then trades may be charged under the misappropriation theory for having taken information from a relationship of confidence or an express statement and an agreement not to use the information, and the fraud there is between the tipper and the tippee, not between, as here, the tipper and the people to whom the tipper owes a fiduciary duty. This is explained in the SEC's Rule 10b5-2, which helps define the kinds of relationships that support a misappropriation theory of liability. But I think, Mr. Chief Justice, what this illustrates is we are not urging a theory in which tippers are per se liable every time inside information is disclosed."
