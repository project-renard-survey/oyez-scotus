I think the question about a fundamental rights line, let me answer that in two ways. First of all, in this case, we don't believe that that's in fact what happened because we think there are a number of fundamental rights that are not categorized in the group that the State court mentioned. And, in fact, what the State court did was identify four or five especially onerous examples of intrusion on fundamental rights and say they -- these are all like arbitration."

With respect to the -- the question about whether the FAA is limited to arbitration agreements, I think it's important to note that the text of the FAA says that arbitration agreements shall be valid irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. So it's true the focus of the FAA is on whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable or not, but there's nothing in the FAA that prohibits its application to an antecedent agreement if that antecedent agreement prohibits the enforcement of the arbitration agreement on a ground that's specific to arbitration. And I think that's not only true of the text of the statutes; it's true because the implications of that rule would be quite dramatic."
