    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In April 2011, Apple Inc. (Apple) sued Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd. (Samsung) and argued that certain design elements of Samsung\u2019s smartphones infringed on specific patents for design elements in the iPhone that Apple holds. The jury held that Samsung had infringed on Apple\u2019s patents and awarded over $1 billion in damages. The district court ordered a partial retrial on the issue of damages because some damages had been awarded for a period in which Samsung did not have notice of some of the asserted patents. On retrial, the jury awarded nearly $300 million in damages. On appeal, Samsung argued that the district court erred in allowing the jury to award damages based on Samsung\u2019s entire profits, rather than the fraction of profits directly attributable to the infringed patents themselves. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s award of damages because Samsung did not argue that there was a lack of substantial evidence to support the award.<\/p>\n",
    "question": "<p>If an infringed design patent only applies to a component of a product, should damages for the infringement be limited to the portion of the infringer\u2019s profits attributable to that component?<\/p>\n",
