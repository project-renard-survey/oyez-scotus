Petitioner here submits three things: First, that invoking a shapeless -- so shapeless a provision to enhance someone's sentence in such a significant way does not comport with due process. Second, a ruling that the career offender residual clause is void for vagueness is substantive and, therefore, has retroactive effect in Petitioner's case. And third, that voiding the residual clause also invalidates the Guidelines commentary that identified Petitioner's offense as a crime of violence. As such, Petitioner is entitled to a resentencing without the career offender enhancement."

But even doing it that way, it then becomes a matter of the extent to which the Federal courts are going to review the substantive Guidelines, itself an open question. So rather than get into that, I might think about your case like this: Why was the statute vague? It was vague because with three examples preceding the residual clause, they tried to apply it, Congress, to thousands of State criminal statutes that vary in a variety of ways one from the other."

So I think the starting point for analysis here is due process."

Now, the history of this country has included discretionary sentencing within a range without any guidance to the judge since the 1790 Crimes Act. And through much of the 19th century, many statutes were written that way. The idea that due process vagueness analysis would somehow invalidate that contradicts cases like Medina, which take as their touchstone for due process historical practice. I also think that the purposes of what later was announced as the vagueness doctrine are not implicated in traditional sentencing."

Serious bodily injury is a very customary element of the offense. The Guidelines were framed to be administrable in factual and judgmental ways that courts administer all the time in criminal law. What was different about the residual clause is that the Court wasn't -- Congress instructed the Commission to put together a career offender guideline that covered people who had crimes of violence or serious drug offenses for their instant offense and two others and they were older than 18. The Commission originally defined crime of violence by borrowing the Section 16(b) definition of crime of violence which Congress adopted in the same act that passed the Sentencing Reform Act. It later switched to the ACCA definition, the residual clause that this Court later invalidated in Johnson."

So when this Court in Johnson overruled the two sentencing residual clause cases that had come out in favor of the government and said that the residual clause was vague across the board, sentencing courts no longer had a legal framework at all to interpret the residual clause except for the commentary."

The judge thinks that the commission intends that this individual be treated as a career offender or somebody who has a firearms offense with a crime of violence in his background, but the judge has no way of knowing whether that is arbitrary or non-arbitrary because the commission, having borrowed vague language, ends with up with a vague statute."

The judge at sentencing could still sentence the defendant to life without parole after a particular finding, i.e., that the individual was irredeemable. Why is that different than here? Meaning, if the Guidelines are procedural in the Montgomery sense because they are an anchor on what a judge does, why isn't there a substantial risk like in Montgomery that a defendant is going to be sentenced because of the Guideline and not because of a finding that he or she is entitled to that sentence? And I take that to be -- that substantial risk to be proven by your own statistic."
