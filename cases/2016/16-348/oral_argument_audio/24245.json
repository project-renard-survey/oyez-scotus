That's very hard to reconcile with the language of the FDCPA because if there is one established principle about the operation of the FDCPA, it is that there is no affirmative state of mind requirement."

And so, again, this is going to be a recipe for bringing these FDCPA actions into play, and many, many bankruptcies. And that leads me to my second point, which is that this Court has never applied the FDCPA within the four corners of a bankruptcy proceeding, and I think that the problem with doing so here is that it really doesn't address the principle concern that Respondent and the government raises, and let me give you an example as to why that's true. Suppose you have a bank that holds credit card debt, and that bank actually doesn't sell that debt on to a debt collector."
