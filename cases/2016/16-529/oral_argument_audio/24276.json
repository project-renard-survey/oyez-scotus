And it's true that there's a separate provision for securities disgorgements in the bankruptcy laws, but that doesn't apply to the disgorgements under other statutes, such as the statute in which the government previously took the position in this Court that disgorgement was a fine, penalty, or forfeiture. So I think that citizens are entitled to basic consistency from the regulators, which doesn't seem to have happened in the context of disgorgement. And I'd like to reserve my time."

So we cite, for instance, the old Maillard case and the old Adams case from the early Republic where the Court is clearly saying that there's a construction in favor of the statute of limitations because, as Chief Justice Marshall said, it would be utterly repugnant not to apply it. We look at the Maillard case involving a value customs forfeiture quite similar to this case in which, again, the judge at the time -- it was a district court -- refused to apply that canon because of the -- the court's view that it shouldn't apply in these backwards-looking remedies. And in fact, the Gabelli case itself I believe is quite strong for us on this, because in that case, if there was some pro-government canon, it wouldn't treat -- the court wouldn't treat the government worse off than private plaintiffs. Thank you."
