Van Akron, in which, similar to Cage, the Court recognized the plain error analysis ability to review the instruction, and quite frankly, as the Court noted in that opinion, the raising of that issue at trial, much for the same reason it wasn't raised at trial in this case, was due to the futility of raising it in light of its prior decisions distinguishing the instruction given in Nebraska from the defective instruction in Cage."
