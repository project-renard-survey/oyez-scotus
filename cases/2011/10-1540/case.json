    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EOn September 22nd, 1993, Archie Dixon and Timothy Hoffner arrived at the Toledo home of Kirsten Wilkerson. Christopher Hammer was staying at Wilkerson\u0027s house. Upon arriving at Wilkerson\u0027s house, Dixon and Hoffner beat up Hammer, tied him to a bed, and robbed him. After restraining Hammer, Dixon and Hoffner proceeded to kill Hammer by burying him alive.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter burying Hammer alive, Dixon used Hammer\u0027s birth certificate and social security card to obtain a state identification card in Hammer\u0027s name. He used the new ID to obtain a duplicate auto title to Hammer\u0027s car. He then sold Hammer\u0027s car to a dealer for $2,800.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn November 4th, a police detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station in a chance encounter. The detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and asked to talk to him about Hammers disappearance; Dixon declined to discuss the disappearance. In the course of the investigation into Hammer\u0027s disappearance, the police discovered that Dixon had sold Hammer\u0027s car and forged Hammer\u0027s signature when cashing the check he received in the sale. On November 9th, the police detained Dixon and charged him with forgery.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe police questioned Dixon without reading him his Miranda rights. The focus of the questioning was Hammer\u0027s disappearance and not Dixon\u0027s alleged act of forgery. Dixon asserted his right to have an attorney present, but the police continued to question Dixon without an attorney. Dixon admitted to the auto title forgery but said that he had no knowledge of Hammer\u0027s disappearance. Later that day, Hoffner led the police to Hammer\u0027s body. The police interviewed Dixon again. They did not inform Dixon of his Miranda rights until the second session because they feared Dixon would request counsel. Dixon confessed to the kidnapping, robbery, and murder.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt trial, Dixon was convicted and sentenced to death for murder, robbery and kidnapping. The Appellate Court and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the conviction. Dixon appealed to the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit, and Judge Gilbert Merritt, writing for the majority, held that the police should have terminated the forgery interrogation when Dixon requested counsel. The court also held that the police\u0027s planned refusal to read Dixon his Miranda rights during the first session of his interrogation for murder was unconstitutional. It further held that Dixon\u0027s were not \u0022voluntary\u0022.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDid the Toledo police violate Dixon\u0027s constitutional rights by failing to read his Miranda rights during the forgery questioning?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDid the police violate the constitution by delaying the reading of Dixon\u0027s Miranda rights until the second session of his interrogation for murder?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWere Dixon\u0027s relevant confessions and statements voluntary?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo, no and yes. In a \u003Cem\u003Eper curiam\u003C\/em\u003E decision, the Court rejected the Sixth Circuit\u0027s ruling. The Court noted that Dixon was not in custody when he asserted his right to an attorney, and denied his ability to assert this right before he was in formal custody. The Court reasoned that the police\u0027s failure to give Dixon his Miranda rights during the forgery interrogation was acceptable under the constitution because his later confession to murder was properly warned and voluntary.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Court rejected the Sixth Circuit\u0027s description of the police\u0027s technique as \u0022question first, warn later\u0022 mainly because Dixon did not repeat a vital earlier admission during the murder interrogation; in other words, the first, unwarned interrogation did not directly enable a confession during the second session. The Court held, generally, that this \u0022two-step interrogation process\u0022 did not unconstitutionally interfere with the effectiveness of the Miranda warnings given to Dixon.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
