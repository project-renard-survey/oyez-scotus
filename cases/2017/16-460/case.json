    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2007, Stephanie Artis was employed by the District of Columbia Department of Health (DOH) as a code inspector. She alleges that she and her supervisor developed a contentious relationship and that he singled her out for unfair treatment in the workplace. On April 17, 2009, Artis took her first administrative step against DOH by filing a discrimination claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and while that claim was pending, DOH terminated Artis\u2019s employment in November 2010.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2011, Artis filed a lawsuit against the District in federal court alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and invoked the district court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction to assert claims based on the District\u2019s Whistleblower Act, False Claims Act, and common law. The district court granted the District\u2019s motion on the pleadings and dismissed Artis\u2019s sole federal claim, violation of Title VII, as facially deficient. It thus found it had no basis to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims.<\/p>\n<p>Fifty-nine days after her claims were dismissed in federal court, Artis filed the remaining claims in a D.C. trial court. The District alleged that Artis\u2019s claims were time barred based on the respective statutes of limitations, and the trial judge agreed, finding that the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. Section 1367(d) does not suspend state statutes of limitations at the time of the unsuccessful federal filing.<\/p>\n",
    "question": "<p>Does the tolling provision in 28 U.S.C. Section 1367(d) suspend the limitations period for the state-law claims while the claim is pending and for 30 days after the claim is dismissed, or does it merely provide 30 days beyond the dismissal for the plaintiff to refile?<\/p>\n",
