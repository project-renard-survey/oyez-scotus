Dowd, we would still rely on the position that the nature and strength of the venireman's opinion is a mixed question of law and fact, and as such, each of the habeas corpus courts must independently review the record before them, and there is far more support for the analysis of the record by the circuit court in its footnotes to its opinion than was done by the state county court or the Pennsylvania Supreme Court."
