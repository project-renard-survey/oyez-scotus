Ullman, I think what you recognized in that case and what I would stress here is that when a state's assertion of power over liberty occurs at the intersection of intimate personal association, which this Court has recognized in a half-century of cases, and the privacy of the home in the clearest possible sense, then there must be at least heightened scrutiny rather than the unquestioning deference that the State of Georgia would request."
