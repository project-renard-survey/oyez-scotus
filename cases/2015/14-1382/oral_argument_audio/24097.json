So in my view -- and I think this case rests upon defining a clear rule, a clear rule that says when you have an artificial entity, we're going to measure by those persons that I consider to be the beneficial owners. And I'll tell you why that's important: Because that is consonant with the rule announced by this Court in Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and Carden. Chapman v. Barney, the doctrinal wall case, those persons that were deemed to be members were the persons that were the stock owners of the joint stock company under New York law. In Great Southern, again a limited partnership case, were those persons that had an economic interest in the entity. And the same rule applied in Carden. If we are to adopt Americold's position in this case and now suggest that the board of trustees that do not have an economic ownership interest in the entity itself controls, we're going to open the floodgates of uncertainty for the under -- for the lower courts. And I'll tell you why. The Court has never explicitly addressed a limited liability company, and they're common throughout the United States."
