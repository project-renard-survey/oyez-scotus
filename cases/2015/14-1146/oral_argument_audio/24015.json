Ordinarily, we would defer to jury verdicts, and we would say that if the jury evaluated the evidence within the realm of what was presented at trial, that is going to get special deference in our legal system. So when those monies get allocated, ordinarily a district judge is going to do so on a basis either of pro rata for all of those -- all of those plaintiffs who were found to be injured, and the 212 who were identified by name, by Dr. Fox, Tyson knew about them before trial, did not move for summary judgment as to those 212, could have easily severed them right out before this case went to the jury. The second way is that Dr. Fox did an analysis using Mericle\u0027s averages and then added them to the number of minutes worked by the particular employee, and so based on that, a vast number got above the 40-hour threshold. Now, the evidence at trial that it came in by Tyson\u0027s own witnesses was that the average worker worked 48 hours per week before you even got to any of the counting of the donning and doffing, and that the plant ran on Saturdays 60 percent of the time, which would be a 6-day work week. And so the evidence as the jury considered it found the vast majority of the class members were already going to be in overtime status, and that\u0027s why the fulcrum of the case came down to whether putting on this gear, which was standard sanitary gear for every single worker in the class, was compensable or not."

And when that exact same fact is relevant to liability insofar as it\u0027s necessary to prove that the employee is pushed over the 40-hour-per-week threshold, then we think that all of the rationales that animated Mt. Clemens would equally apply to the determination of that particular fact in that context. But we think the Mt. Clemens itself signaled that this might be an appropriate determination at the liability phase because it recognized at the outset that the burden of proving that you have performed work for which you were not properly compensated shouldn\u0027t be an impossible burden."
