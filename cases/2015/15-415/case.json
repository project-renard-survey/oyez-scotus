Hector Navarro was employed there as a service advisor, which involved him greeting customers and assessing their needs as they entered the business. Navarro, along with other similarly situated plaintiffs, sued Encino for failing to pay overtime compensation when they worked more than forty hours a week. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, \u201cservice advisors\u201d engaged in servicing automobiles are not entitled to overtime compensation, so district court dismissed their overtime claim. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court\u2019s decision and held that Navarro and other employees were not exempted from overtime compensation.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
