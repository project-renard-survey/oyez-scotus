There, Congress uses the words \"in violation of,\" an offense which is in violation of a particular Federal statute. The upshot of Petitioner's position is that any time there's an interstate-commerce jurisdictional element in any of the Federal provisions that are referred to, only a violation of the Federal statute, only a Federal criminal prosecution and conviction will count as an aggravated felony, because no State crime, no foreign crime is ever going to have interstate commerce as an element. If that's what Congress had meant, if it had meant to strict it to violations of that Federal statute, then, again, it had language at its fingertips that it has used elsewhere in this provision that would have allowed it to do that. And there's one other aspect of the statutory text that I'd like to mention, and that's just a particular example of a place where Petitioner's reading doesn't make sense in a -- in a particular context, in the statute."

It would also really multiply the difficulty of the proceedings and make them much longer and harder. And I do think the language here is a little different here than the language that the Court was looking at in Nijhawan, where this $10,000 limitation was in the aggravated felony provision itself and it was worded in a particular way that the Court seized on. I -- I -- so I just don't think that analysis necessarily carries over here. But again, I think that all of the various signs that you would use to interpret the statute -- and -- and by the way, four of the courts of appeals that have addressed this have said the statute is unambiguously clear."
