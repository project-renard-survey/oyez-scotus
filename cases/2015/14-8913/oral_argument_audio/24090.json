Second, presumption is unnecessary, because courts of appeal are capable of discerning prejudice on a case-specific basis.

It will be lower in the case of an overlapping range. But as this Court said in Glover v. United States, any extra amount of imprisonment affects substantial rights. Finally, I just wanted to say that the courts of appeals have overwhelmingly recognized, whether you call it a presumption or not, that it is warranted to find that a change in the Guideline range affected a defendant's substantial rights because of the extreme likelihood that a Guideline-range error will skew the sentence. And the lower courts have found, in their experience, that it's necessary to make that inference because of the great difficulty in the typical case of showing a case-specific effect of the type that the government is arguing for here. And these two factors mean that this inference or presumption, whatever it's termed, is necessary to avoid, in many cases, the injustice of excess imprisonment. And it will not blow up Rule 52(b), as the government warns."
