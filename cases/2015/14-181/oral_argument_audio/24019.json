Now, of course ERISA plans, like other regular businesses, are subject to ancillary regulation like maintaining a safe workplace, paying minimum wage and prevailing wage laws, paying their State real estate taxes on their headquarters, and if they choose to run a hospital, run a law firm for their legal services, benefit program, run a childcare center, they are subject to local regulation like other providers of those local services. But in every single case in this Court, and every lower court decision that I have found in which courts have upheld, State by State, reporting requirements, it has always been incident to a substantive obligation that the State could impose."
