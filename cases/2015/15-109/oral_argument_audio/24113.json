The -- the next reason is that it's -- that that reading of Smith is inconsistent with numerous other provisions of the original FTCA. Justice Kagan, you just said that, you know, the plain text seems to say that they wanted to exempt 2680 claims from all of the provisions of the FTCA, and arguably, that's what the literal language seems to say. But if you look at the original FTCA, that -- that cannot possibly be what -- what that language means. And so let me point you just to four different provisions of the original FTCA that don't seem to make sense under that reading. The first of those provisions is Section 402 of the original FTCA, and we've reproduced that at page 10a of the appendix to our brief."
