    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003ECuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC. (Cuozzo) owns the 074 patent, \u201cSpeed Limit Indicator and Method for Displaying Speed and the Relevant Speed Limit,\u201d and Garmin International, Inc. (Garmin) petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) for \u003Cem\u003Einter partes\u003C\/em\u003E review of claims regarding the patent. The Board was established to process patent litigation faster by using \u003Cem\u003Einter partes\u003C\/em\u003E review, and during that process, the Board uses the broadest reasonable interpretation when reviewing patent claims instead of the plain and ordinary meaning of patent claims. The Board found that claims 10, 14, and 17 were unpatentable. Cuozzo filed a motion to amend by replacing claims 10, 14, and 17 with claims 21, 22, and 23. The Board denied this request by applying the broadest reasonable interpretation standard to the term \u201cintegrally attached\u201d regarding claim 14 on the components of the \u201cSpeed Limit Indicator.\u201d Cuozzo appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which held that it lacked authority to review the Board\u2019s finding under the broadest reasonable interpretation.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
