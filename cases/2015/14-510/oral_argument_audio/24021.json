In the Irwin case, this Court specifically cross-referenced American Pipe as an example of a defective pleading that could satisfy equitable tolling. American Pipe obviously being a class-action tolling rule. We read that cross-reference as a suggestion that, under the right circumstances, if somebody reasonably relies on class-action tolling facts that ultimately prove to be ineffective, that that individual has the ability to ask the Court to find that equitable tolling should apply. If there is such a case, the facts of this case really should satisfy this test. The test is set forth in the Holland case. Due diligence and extraordinary circumstances are the two prongs that have to be satisfied."

If the Tribe had filed at the beginning of that process and received a rejection of its claim during the first 100, 150 days -- let\u0027s give the government, you know, ample time to respond -- then it would have triggered a statute of limitations that was jurisdictional that the Tribe would have had to have acted on, in order to make sure that its claim was, in fact, going to still be alive. And that would have happened before the end of the 707 days. So it\u0027s more than a stamp in an envelope. It really is a jurisdictional conundrum that the Tribe was aware of and concerned about, that partially factored into the Tribe\u0027s decision not to file a claim."
