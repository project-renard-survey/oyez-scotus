So it may be the case that the first question presented as drafted by the pro se litigant when it was -- and granted by this Court suggests to you the question is that whether the district court erred.

Now, that case under under -- under Bousley would be retroactive, because it is an interpretation and -- and everybody who falls out of that core scope would get the benefit of -- of Skilling retroactively, and that's what the court of -- courts of appeals have concluded. Now if the Court denies retroactivity here, what it would be saying was -- is if the three justices in Skilling had their way and instead the Court had concluded that there is no possible interpretation of this statute, it's incapable of interpretation, all of those same people -- if the Court went the further step, all of those same people would be denied relief, and that -- we think that's entirely arbitrary."

Linkletter explained that even when this Court invalidates a statute, the prior existence of that statute is an operative fact that cannot justly be ignored. So we've moved past, well past any notion where a law that has been declared subsequently unconstitutional simply disappears, and we must all pretend it never existed."
