Before they take you in and take you off the road, they're doing this test as part of the probable cause evaluation: Is there enough probable cause to bring you in? There may be, independent of it, but sometimes the breath test exonerates people and they go on their merry way. So why are we thinking that it is only evidentiary? I do think the blood test is, by the way. Once you've arrested someone, you've decided to take them off the road, and the road is now safe from that person."

So if I could then turn to the -- to the bright-line criminal rule that I understand to be the core of Petitioner's case, in McNeely, this Court said that a State may condition driving on public roads and may require as a condition that a motorist arrested or detained for drunk driving agree to a BAC testing and that the State may impose significant consequences on the subsequent refusal.
