And I think it's not. It may not be the better policy in your view, but it's certainly one that is consistent with the spirit of ERISA, and so the decision that needs to be made is: What is this line of cases that this Court has decided? What did they say?

And so the framework this Court developed was to distinguish between equitable relief on the one hand and things like damages that, clearly, Congress didn't mean to include in the relief that would be available. And so -- I think it's been true since Great-West when this Court interpreted equitable relief pretty narrowly that a beneficiary will have an incentive in some cases to structure a settlement in order to avoid paying reimbursement to the Plan."
