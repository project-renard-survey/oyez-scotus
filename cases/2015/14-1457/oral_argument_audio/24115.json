So I think one of the questions that Justice Sotomayor is asking is: Why wouldn't that be equally appropriate here? In other words, even if -- and I'm not saying that this is right, but even if there's -- this is -- falls within the due process box rather than the Sixth Amendment box, that there's still a further question as to whether the Lovasco approach is right or whether this U.S. currency approach is right."

And this gets to another point that the United States made, and that is that -- that the conviction changes everything, because the concerns that the court articulated in Barker may be yet more significant at the sentencing stage, given that most convictions today result from guilty pleas. And so the fact that a defendant -- their defense may be impaired by a delay in criminal proceedings, may be more significant at the sentencing stage because it may be the only place where the defendant challenges an upward adjustment or contests facts. The fact that the defendant may need to access rehabilitation programs may be more pronounced at sentencing because the defendant's already been convicted, they're going to serve time, and they want to get access to the programs that they'll need to get parole as soon as -- as possible. So we submit that -- that Barker is the appropriate test; that if the Court agrees that Barker -- Barker's the appropriate framework, that the proper right to ground that analysis in is the Sixth Amendment and not the Due Process Clause. And that is particularly so because of the antecedents of the Due Process Clause which -- which apply, not just to the -- the guilt stage of the prosecution, but also to sentencing."
