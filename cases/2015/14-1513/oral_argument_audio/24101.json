The Federal Circuit has done that by moving away from historical practice in two key ways. First, it's made the test all about recklessness rather than also intent. Second, it judges recklessness based on legal defenses developed in litigation rather than the facts at the time of the infringement. The net result, now that this Court in Octane and Highmark set aside a similarly artificial test for fees is a one-of-its-kind, good for patent-damages-only framework that does not track the enhancement statute's text, history, or purposes. It was not always this way."

Now, if it had turned out that in those German sources they had, in fact, demonstrated that that patent was invalid, the position of the world would be that's great, because this patent should be declared invalid and the monopoly that attaches to it should be declared null and void and unenforceable. The fact that they found it and it turns out not to get you over the hump shouldn't be, by any stretch of the imagination, lead to a -- to a standard of the law that discourages us from going out and trying to find both the limits of the metes and bounds of the patent itself as -- as defined by the -- by the patent holder, and to challenge the invalidity of those patents under all circumstances.
