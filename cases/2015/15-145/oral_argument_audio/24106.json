The first is that this Court has said many times that when Congress uses a term that has an established common-law meaning, courts should give it that meaning when it's used in a statute. For centuries, the term \"fraud\" has been used at common law to refer to schemes that are in -- that -- that where property is transferred with the -- with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. There is no reason to give that text any different meaning than in Section 523(a)(2)(a). The second is that our view is the only thing that -- the only interpretation that gives any meaning to the 1978 amendment. And the third is that our view is consistent with Congress's overarching purpose and the Bankruptcy Code, that -- that dishonors creditors -- excuse me -- dishonors debtors, not be permitted to use the Code to get rid of their debts. Now, Respondent offers a competing textual interpretation of the term -- of the phrase \"or actual fraud.\" I think Petitioner has explained well why that interpretation doesn't make any sense as an -- as a grammatical matter."
