The Ninth Circuit's constitutional analysis disconnects the validity of the underlying prior conviction from the permissibility of relying on those convictions to prove the defendant's recidivist status if he commits additional criminal conduct."

And I don't think that the placement, whether in a sentencing enhancement or -- or as an element of a crime, should make any difference with respect to the purpose to which that conviction is being put. Now, it's certainly the case the different standards of review apply and that the conviction at the sentencing enhancement needs to be proofed only by a preponderance, whereas at the guilt stage it would have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt."

And courts that have considered the constitutionality of those schemes have reasoned that there's nothing inherently problematic with giving effect to that civil adjudication. I think this reflects too that the States and jurisdictions have broad leeway to structure their recidivist statutes, whether they make them elements, whether they make them sentencing factors."

So I think that the nature of the proceeding here really is critical in helping to understand why Congress's judgment was rational, why the -- why the Indian Civil Rights Act represents a reasonable baseline level of -- of procedural fairness that's guaranteed to tribal-court defendants, and why there's nothing wrong, then, with giving effect to those tribal-court judgments if the defendant fails to learn from his past behavior and his past punishment. These are offenders who have been repeatedly punished by their tribal courts."

Actually, I think this is notable because I think it shows that Congress, in recent years, every time it's looked at how tribal courts are functioning and has made a determination about the rights and -- and what to recognize in those tribal-court proceedings, it's acted to recognize expanded authority for tribal courts, both with their sentencing authority, with respect to their jurisdiction. So I do think that that reflects legislative judgment that tribal courts are sufficiently protective of individual rights, and that there's no fundamental unfairness that's occurring in those proceedings that would cause, I think, this Court to question the reliability of those determinations. And I would point again to Respondent's concession that if he had simply been fined in tribal court and had not received a sentence of imprisonment, then there would be no problem with giving effect to those tribal-court convictions."
