And to give an example of that -- I mean, I think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains only to one defendant, but that that aggravating evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that the jury couldn't really separate the two and would be inclined to sort of judge the second one by association. So I think that's the example the Court gives in Zafiro."

These are precisely the sort of evidence that shows that however bad you think Jonathan is, Reginald is worse because Reginald is the one who created the person Jonathan is. It's in a sense making Reginald doubly culpable for these offenses; that, well, whatever you think Jonathan did -- and yes, as Justice Scalia read, there were some horrific things done -- well, Reginald should be punished for not only everything Reginald did, but also everything Jonathan did. So this is precisely the sort of evidence that basically transfers all of Jonathan's actions to Reginald."

And to go back to Justice Kagan's question about the intuitive difference between these two things, they're between -- excuse me -- trials and -- and penalty-phase proceedings, the answer is that's because in a -- in a trial, the -- the relative culpability of the defendants makes a big difference with respect to who's a conspirator, who's not a conspirator, who's a principal, who's an aider and abettor. But when we turn to the penalty phase, the inquiry changes, as Mr. Liu indicated -- it changes from exactly what happened to who this person is and whether or not the jury wants to put this person to death."
