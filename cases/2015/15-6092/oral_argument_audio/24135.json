And when you talk about, you know, things like that where the Court in itself has assumed that the drug statutes would be divisible, and we don't know that answer for a case like California, I think it -- it would really be a remarkable change to what the Court has done so far with the modified categorical approach.

And of course, you know the modified categorical approach is used in so many different areas, and so these problems with parsing State law, et cetera, would just be multiplied through all of the other different statutes in which the Court has used the modified categorical approach.
