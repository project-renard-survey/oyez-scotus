If, for example, there was a way of achieving the political objectives without respect to the racial composition of the enacted district, then it should be simple as pie for plaintiffs to come in with an alternative that doesn't rely on race that achieves their legitimate political objectives, and yet plaintiffs in the district court here have proved that any realteration of District 3 which results in a diminution of the black voting-age population would be absolutely contrary to the normal political agenda that would be motivating the legislature if everybody involved was white. The plaintiff's alternative only reduced the BVAP by 3 percent to 50 percent, and yet that converted District 2 with a brand-new Republican incumbent from a toss-up district to what plaintiffs themselves characterize as a heavily Democratic district."

Your Honor is recognizing that incumbency protection is one of the neutral districting principles no different than compactness or anything else, which gives incumbents special factual distinctions from the run-of-the-mill people. In Term Limits v. Thornton, this Court held it was unconstitutional to make it more difficult for incumbents to be reelected because they had to engage in mail-in campaigns rather than be on the ballot. So we are talking about a well-recognized constitutional right where incumbents do -- are not similarly situated to average voters and do have very different factual interests."
