The answer is that if those Belgium banks are in a conspiracy with RJR, it surely cannot be the case that U.S. law does not cover RJR. If there is a question about the enforceability of a judgment against the Belgium banks, presumably the Belgium banks will make that argument, and they will claim in Belgium that -- that somehow a suit prosecuted in the United States in which they were co-conspirators is somehow not going to cover their activity. Our point is that it can't be the case where, for centuries, the United States courts have been open to allow foreign plaintiffs to come in alleging injury caused by U.S. actors under U.S. law, that somehow we're going to read the Morrison principle as a way of constricting the available remedies."

A third principle is the Charming Betsy canon, that you construe Federal statutes not to violate international law absent a very clear statement to the contrary, and that's what we have here, because Empagran says that applying U.S. law to provide redress for foreign injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would be unreasonable, and therefore, a violation of customary international law. You also ask why draw the line at injury? Once you established the underlying, the underlying predicate applies extraterritorially. First reason is that the decision to create a private right of action is -- is different from the decision to criminalize the conduct."
