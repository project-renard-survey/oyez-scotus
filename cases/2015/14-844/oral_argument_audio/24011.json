One, the per-prisoner approach best comports with the statutory text. Two, the per-prisoner approach is the only one consistent with the careful balance Congress struck between deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits and preserving their right to bring meritorious ones. And three, the per-prisoner approach avoids anomalies and disincentives that Congress could never have intended, disincentives such as discouraging prisoner work by taking one hundred percent of their income month after month. I would like to, of course, start with the text."

But you -- you touch on a question that is unsettled in the lower courts, which is does the amount come due at the end of when the prisoner -- when the prisoner sentence ends? And the courts of appeals are divided about that, with the Fifth Circuit saying, yes, it does come due, and you have to come up with some kind of a plan with each of the clerks to which you owe money, and you shall pay it off."

In the Coleman case the Court was considering the three-strikes provision, but it recognized that that provision is written from the perspective of a single case, a single action, or appeal."
