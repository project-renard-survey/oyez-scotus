We do not believe and we believe that McClanahan v. Arizona settled that question that the state cannot force a tribal member to collect a cigarette tax owed by a non-member and for which a non-member is guilty of a state violation should he purchase and have in his property or in his possession such a cigarette tax and the state of Montana has criminal jurisdiction over that non-Indian should he violate the State Law."
