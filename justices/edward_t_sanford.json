    "biography": "\u003Cp\u003EEdward Sanford was elevated from his perch as a federal trial judge in Tennessee to the nation\u0027s highest court by President Warren G. Harding after the strenuous lobbying efforts of Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Sanford seemed to return that loyalty by joining with the Chief Justice regularly while they were on the Court. Sanford also participated in Taft\u0027s \u0022inner club\u0022 of conservative justices who met at Taft\u0027s home on Sunday afternoons.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESanford contributed to the domain of civil liberties when he spoke for the Court upholding a state anarchy statute. Implicit in Sanford\u0027s reasoning was the notion that some provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with equal force to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause. This idea would have extraordinary consequences for the nationalization of the Bill of Rights during the era of the Warren Court.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESanford\u0027s career on the Court ended when he died unexpectedly on the same day as the death of his mentor, retired Chief Justice William Howard Taft.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
