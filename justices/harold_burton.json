He practiced law in Ohio and later served as the mayor of Cleveland.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBurton holds the unusual distinction of being the only Republican appointed to the Supreme Court from 1933 to 1953, a period of virtually complete Democratic control. He proved to be the most liberal of Truman\u0027s four appointments. He possessed extraordinary personal charm. As one scholar wrote, \u0022probably no member of the...Court enjoyed greater affection from his colleagues on the bench....\u0022 But his liberal views did not always protect individual rights, as his opinion for the Court in the Bute case makes plain.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
