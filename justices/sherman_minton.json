    "biography": "\u003Cp\u003ESherman Minton was elected to the United States Senate from Indiana in 1934. He was a strong advocate of Roosevelt\u0027s \u0022Court-Packing\u0022 plan. After his losing reelection bid in 1940, Roosevelt appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Minton was nominated to the Supreme Court by Harry Truman, a close personal friend. Ill health forced Minton\u0027s resignation in 1956. Minton disappointed most liberals by consistently preferring order to freedom. Minton voted to uphold statutes intended to protect the national security; he rejected challenges asserting violations of individual liberties. Upon his retirement, Minton observed: \u0022There will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing. I\u0027m an echo.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
