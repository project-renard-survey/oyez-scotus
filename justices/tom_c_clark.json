    "biography": "\u003Cp\u003ETom C. Clark was born, raised, and educated in Texas. The son of a prominent politician, Clark was active in Texas Democratic politics. He joined the Justice Department in 1937 and served as civilian coordinator of the forced evacuation of Japanese-Americans from the West Coast during World War II. President Harry S Truman appointed Clark attorney general in 1945, and nominated him to the High Court in 1949. Truman later lamented his choice. \u0022It\u0027s not that he\u0027s a bad man,\u0022 rued Truman. \u0022It\u0027s just that he\u0027s the dumbest sonofabitch I ever met.\u0022 Clark resigned in 1967 to avoid any question of conflict of interest after President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Clark\u0027s son, Ramsey, to serve as Attorney General.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
